# VOCODE

### Voice-controlled Snippet Management

*This desktop application built with Electron using the [electron-react-boilerplate.](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)*

### How to use

Users can call up a number of boilerplate snippets including:
  - React Components (both stateful and stateless)
  - Redux Store, Reducer
  - Express
  - Webpack
  - HTML
  - CSS

After login, a user can:
  - Add other user snippets with (+). These snippets can be forked and edited.
  - Create new snippets which can be called up by voice.

Websites (github, stackoverflow, waffle) can be called up by voice. Homepages are shown by default. A user can add their screenname(s) via a Profile page.
